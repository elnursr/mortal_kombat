            "description": "Cyrax was born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei's many sub-clans. For generations it has maintained a quiet presence in Niger’s Aïr mountains, where it stands ready to defend Earthrealm. <br/> <br/> A martial arts prodigy, Cyrax was the youngest Zaki to ever become an active Lin Kuei warrior. That success earned her an invitation to serve directly under Sektor. <br/> <br/> Cyrax seized the opportunity with her trademark vigor. But while her skills have endeared her Sektor, her independent streak has not. <br/> <br/> Despite Sektor’s best efforts to break it, Cyrax’s will remains untamed. She will serve the Lin Kuei on her terms, or not at all."

Apprenticing with him, she eventually surpassed her father's skills. When he retired, she took his place. <br/> <br/> But Sektor also wanted to honor her mother’s legacy. Now her vast knowledge of weaponry and her formidable martial skills make Sektor a kombatant like no other. <br/> <br/> Sensing Sektor was a kindred spirit, Sub-Zero shared with her his grand vision for the Lin Kuei's future. She joined his efforts immediately. <br/> <br/> Now Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, Sektor will force the Lin Kuei to evolve. Those who cannot change will be eliminated."
